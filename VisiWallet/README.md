# Safety Notice
NOTE: This software is intended for creative and aesthetic uses rather than security. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  This application is NOT a replacement to existing cold storage and hardware SSWallet options.  There is no safer alternative than storing your bitcoin in a total offline environment secured with the latest encryption standards.  Treat photographs taken with this app like you would treat your most embarrassing nudes.  Anyone with the original photograph or an exact copy of it, AND the proper knowledge/equipment - such as this app on another phone - will be able to access the funds in your photowallet.


# Visual Wallet
Create a discreet bitcoin SSWallet out of a camera photograph or image from the internet.

While this is a very cool feature(in my opinion), for security purposes i.e. if the intent is for personal bitcoin storage, it is advised that you DO NOT use an image downloaded from the internet due to the ubiquity and readily available nature of online photographs. Instead you should take a unique, candid photograph from your phone's camera.  Every photowallet generated will also generate a unique 24 word backup seed phrase like a normal SSWallet.  You should write the words down on a piece of paper and secure them properly. The general rule for all wallets that are NOT hardware wallets, is that you should never store more than 1 months salary on it for any extended period of time.

# General Usage Notes
1. It is actually safe to share the images onto social media networks.  Social networks such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter etc..., preprocess and compress all images uploaded to their servers, permanently altering the original sequence of data that was computed to generate the SSWallet during the process. The original photograph is unaffected by this procedure.


2. I would advise against sending a copy of any photowallets to your email, through SMS or any form of cloud storage as images.  If you would rather have a backup of a photowallet in an online environment, then it would be safer to export the image as raw encrypted binary data which you could then decrypt and restore the original image at a later time(this feature is not available yet).


3. This app saves all photowallets taken in your phone's internal storage system.  Smartphone internal storage is *generally* considered safe so long as you have proper security measures activated on your phones device such as fingerprint authentication or some sort of lockscreen mechanism.


4. The best way to utilize a photowallet as a legitimate backup to secure your bitcoin would be to take a candid photo or selfie from your phone's own camera and store it on an encrypted flash drive in a cool, indoor, locked and safe environment.  Remember to delete all other copies and write down the unique seed phrase as yet another backup.

5. There could be a very specific use case for this app that may interest a few.  When dealing with crypto good protection protocol dictates that a person should remain as secretive as possible with any knowledge that could potentially compromise the security of the funds in an account.  So, in the event that someone passes away, the coins they own are generally lost or "burned", as all knowledge of their private keys would die alongside the person, becoming forever locked away and unusable.  Having a photowallet as a backup could potentially solve an issue of needing to pass down enough *information* about the existence of private keys to notify someone of what they *look* like, without revealing any compromising data such as keys, passwords or seed words themselves, in the event that a deceased persons' cryptocurrency need be reclaimed by a loved one or heir.

   The way it would work is by doing an intentional reproduction of the compression process outlined in General Usage Notes #1, which states why sharing a photo over social media is actually safe because of the preprocessing a photo undergoes when it is added to social media.  The steps are outlined as follows:

   1. The person would take a picture with this app, generating a photowallet.

   2. The person would then copy and reprocess the copied photo, not losing any visual information about the photo but rearranging the binary information of the photo. This can be done with any simple lossy compression algorithm such as JPEG.  In this way, the compression algorithm acts as a one way function, making it infeasible compute the original dataset(image) that was used to generate the result.

   3. The person's compressed copy of the photo is then given to a trusted person with a notification in the case of death to look for a visually identical photo which would be somewhere in the possession of the sender.

   4. If/when the sender dies, the person(s) with knowledge of the photo could then search for the original photo that contains the SSWallet, which is assumed to be somewhere in the sender's possessions.  When it is found, all they need to do to repossess the funds would be to run it through the same algorithm this application uses.

HAVE FUN, BE SAFE! :)
